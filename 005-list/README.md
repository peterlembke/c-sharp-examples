# Example number 005 in C#
In this example we will use lists.
An array can not add/remove items but a list can.

## List
If you want to have a variable length array then you must use lists.
Read about [list in the doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=netcore-3.1).

Read an [article about list](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/c-sharp-list/).

There is a lot of built in commands in the List class. This example show some of them.

## Define a list
When you declare the list you also set the object type that will be used in the list.

## Add item
Built in method to add another item that has an instance of the right object type.

## Change item
Looping trough the list works well. You get access to each individual item.
Then you can reference the item properties and change them.

## Remove item by index
Built in function to RemoveAt(3) - Index number 3 i this example is the 4th item because we count from 0.

## Remove item by search
Built in function to Remove() an item by finding it from an ID field.  
See required functions MyClass -> Person: Equals and GetHashCode.

## Find item
With Find() you can loop trough the list and find the item you want.

## Run example
The example will output this:
